we dont need app.jsx like this when we use react router 
what we need now is a routerprovider in main.jsx 
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <>
    <Header />
    <Footer />
    <Home />
    
    </>
  )
}

=> header,home,footer dont need to be called at every page , we use the layot.jsx for the optimization.
