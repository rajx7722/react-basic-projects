## Introduction

This repository serves as a learning playground for those who are new to React and want to understand its core concepts through hands-on practice. Each project focuses on a different aspect of React, such as components, state management, props, and more.

## Projects

Here is a list of projects included in this repository:

1. **Background Changer**: A simple app that changes the background color of the page on user interaction.
2. **Currency Converter**: An application that converts amounts between different currencies using an external API.
3. **Password Generator**: A tool that generates random passwords based on user-specified criteria such as length and character types.
4. **counter**: A basic counter app that demonstrates the use of state and event handling in React.

Each project is contained within its own directory, along with specific instructions on how to run and explore it.

## Getting Started
